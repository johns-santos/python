# I am hard working, fast learned,  IT professional with over 15 years of customer support experience. As a senior Administrator, I've trained, mentored interal and external admin. As I saw it as an opportunity to expand their skill sets to meet the growing needs of customers and in the case of the external admin their own organization. This freed me to focus on more complex issues such as deployments and integration.
